## Nothing here?

Since the models are quite large binary files (300MB+), we not store them in git.

### Stage 3
Go ahead and download the model for stage 3 [here (OneDrive)](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsgNiZqtyG1vgfVxO_WaSBLH7_q9mg?e=gjKGE8)
and paste it into this folder.

Later on we might provide the models via s3-Bucket.
