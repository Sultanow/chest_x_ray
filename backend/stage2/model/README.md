## Nothing here?

Since the models are quite large binary files (300MB+), we not store them in git.

### Stage 2
Go ahead and download the model for stage 2 [here (OneDrive)](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AsgNiZqtyG1vgfVwhJoY50zHdqu5Vg?e=ab4pmc)
and paste it into this folder.

Later on we might provide the models via s3-Bucket.
