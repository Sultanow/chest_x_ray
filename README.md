# Chest x ray classification with CNNs

Aim of this project is to explore lung masks using preliminary segmentation to improve classification of pneumonia Chest X-rays.  
The prototype in the form of an angular application is intended for simple visualization 

This repo contains a casaced of CNNs for classifying chest-x-ray images.

0. Unet lung segmentation
1. Normal vs. Pneumonia CNN
2. Viral vs. Bacterial CNN

# Disclaimer (!)
This prototype must not be used for medical purposes. 
The CNNs used here were trained on a very limited data set. 
Please do not claim diagnostic performance of a model without a clinical study.
